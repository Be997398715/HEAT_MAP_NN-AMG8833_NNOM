# HEAT_MAP_NN-AMG8833_NNOM
Mainly using AMG8833,  RT-Thread and NNOM libs to run heat-map recognition and setup neural network on STM32F4

This project is my first attempt to do a neural network recognizing heat-map on stm32f4.
Main references are: 
1. NNOM : https://github.com/majianjia/nnom
2. RE-Thread : https://www.rt-thread.org/document/site/tutorial/quick-start/introduction/introduction/

This is the first version, more information seeing readme.txt
